# McPy

A Minecraft server implementation written in Python

## Why should you use McPy?
McPy aims to be as fast as possible, while keeping as many game mechanics same as vanilla, and including a plugin system by default.

## Where can I download McPy?
McPy is currently under heavy development: very few things are actually working. As such, no download is available.

## How can I help development?
Check out the issues and see if you can help solve one. If you've solved it, open a PR and it'll be merged into master.
